# The-Movie
An Android app that demonstrate usage of nested recyclerview and retrofit to consume REST api

Here in this App I am consuming TheMovieDatabase API and using Retrofit for the same.

To use this project you need to register for an API key at TheMovieDatabase. Find the instructions to register [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Use the key you obtained by above process to replace *'your_api_key'* in *The-Movie/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml* file.

Below is the app screen -
